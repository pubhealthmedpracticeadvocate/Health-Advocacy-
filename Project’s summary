Refugee Health (Health Advocacy for Refugees in Cairo/ Egypt)
In Egypt, I have worked at PSTIC in partnership within UNHCR and IOM by advocating to make sure that the refugees who came from war zone countries or countries of conflicts are receiving their healthcare from the local medical facilities and providers in Egypt which was and still a burden even for the locals. Those refugees are staying in Egypt till they get a resettlement to a final home country via UNHCR resettlement program. I have created and implemented a health advocacy program and a health advocacy team (HAT) with the support of my director by using medical professional refugees so to serve the idea of “from the refugees to the refugees”
My work with this project particularly was from November 2013 till April 2014
